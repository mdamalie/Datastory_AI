# 📊 Data Story: The Effects of AI on Food Affordability  
### Using COVID-19 as a Benchmark for Measuring AI’s Real Impact

This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence has influenced food affordability** from 2017–2025, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a baseline for disruption. It combines **data analysis, visualization, and storytelling** to uncover how AI reshaped supply chains, pricing patterns, and food accessibility.

## 📌 Summary of the Data Story

When COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, food systems worldwide became unstable. As shelves emptied and prices rose, governments and industries turned toward **AI-powered forecasting, logistics, and automation** for stability.

This project uses the pandemic as a **benchmark** to evaluate what changed:

### 🧠 Key Insights
- **AI helped stabilize some food categories**, but not all.  
- **Post-AI price volatility increased** for several staples.  
- **Efficiency gains from automation did not always lower prices**.  
- **Technological access remains unequal** — small producers benefitted less.  
- **Price trends show a clear upward shift** across multiple categories after 2021.  

### 🧮 Methods Used
- Monthly food prices: **2017–2025**
- Yearly averages  
- AI-period grouping:
  - *Pre-AI (2017–2019)*  
  - *During-AI (2020–2021)*  
  - *Post-AI (2022–2025)*  
- Volatility (standard deviation)  
- Category classification (meat, dairy, produce, grains, etc.)  
- Scrollytelling narrative powered by visuals

## 📈 Visuals Included
- **Milk, Oranges, Eggs, and Bread price trends**  
- **Category-level price trajectories**  
- **Volatility & instability charts**  
- **Top price increase products (Pre-AI vs Post-AI)**  
- **Category-level % change analysis**

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project
This data story aims to show:

- How AI *actually* affected food affordability  
- Where AI improved resilience  
- Where pricing remained unstable  
- How vulnerable communities were impacted  
- What lessons COVID-19 taught us about global food systems  

The story blends **empathy, analytics, and narrative design** to highlight why responsible AI adoption matters for food security.
